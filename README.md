# Weather Widget Technical Test

Thankyou for the oppurtunity to take part in the StackUp Digital technical test. This repository contains my submission of the Weather Widget built in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

There is many ways I could have approached this task however I opted with the above as i though it would display more of my coding ability.

Things I could have used to achieve this are listed below:
- Tailwind CSS (Achieve the figma layout and design)
- Bulma.io (Achieve the figma layout and design)
- Bootstrap (Achieve the figma layout and design)
- momentjs (Easier manipulation of the APIs dates)
- PostCSS (Have used in past projects and is of no concern to add into the workflow)
- SaSS (Have used in past projects and is of no concern to add into the workflow)

## Design Process

I predominantly use Photoshop in my day to day workflow, however it has been a pleasant experience working with figma. I have tried to match the design as closely as possible whilst maintaining good responsiveness with this Weather Widget.

Elements I would have added personally added to this design would include:
- Displaying a title based on the location of the selected button, however I left this be for the purpose of this .

Elements of the design I have strayed away from:
- In regard to the dividers between the individual weather reports I have opted to use borders to achieve this affect although this does make the line taller than the design as they are always as tall as their parent. I could have exactly achieved the design however in my opinion this would require bad code in my opinion via adding the line to the :after element of each weather card. See example: https://codepen.io/astockwell/pen/wqzhL

## Responsiveness

As a last note, I would have also liked to have displayed mobile as two across weather cards. However, due to the design only referencing five days have left mobile one across as the divisibility would not work for the proposed layout.

## Widget Location

I have uploaded the widget onto Netlify for you:

Let me know if you have any problems. Looking forwarded to your comments, this has been a fantastic learning experience.
